IPTSTATE WISHLIST
Wishlist features should be filed in the Wishlist tracker on our sourceforge page.

This is an overview of the common ones and where they are on the priority list.

Features coming soon:
- Filtering hostnames
- Display NAT'd IP

Features that may come later:
- Secondary sorting
- Display packets/bytes per interval instead of just total
- Display the "CONNMARK" value of each connection

Features I probably won't add because I'm not that interested, or 
don't feel they belong, or would be too much work, or some
combination therein.
- Full regex filtering
